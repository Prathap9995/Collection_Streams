LAMBDA :-

* To bring the functional programming features in java we introduced Lambda Expressions.
* For code optimization.[Conize]

Lambda Expression is a anonymous function[Which does not have name of the method and doesn't have return type and no access modifiers]
* In lambda expressions no need to specify data type of variables
	i,e (a,b)->SOP(a+b);
* Consider we need to write return statement in a method and need to write lambda for that like below
	i,e (a)->{return(a*a);}; ----> i,e (a)->(a*a);--->[a->a*a;] If we want to use return statement then we must declare it within curly braces.
	
Some of valid and invalid expressions;
1. n->return n*n;		->Invalid
2. n->{return n*n;};	->Valid
3. n->{return n*n};		->Invalid
4. n->{n*n;};			->Invalid
5. n->n*n;				->Valid
